# Hetionet
This is a project that recreates a portion of the well-known Hetionet from the 2 csv files containing Nodes and Metaedges.
It uses graph database Neo4j and its query language Cypher.
Everything was done from a Python notebook interface including adding and retrieving nodes and relationships from the database.
